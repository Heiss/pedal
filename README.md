# Pedal

Pedal is a universal (client and server side rendering) web app POC that uses:

-   https://github.com/bikeshaving/crank as view layer
-   https://github.com/lukeed/navaid as front end router
-   https://github.com/lukeed/polka as back end router

## TODO's

-   Implement state management (maybe https://github.com/mostjs/core)
-   Implement styles (maybe https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss)
-   Nested routes (maybe use third parameter in route definitions as children and recurse on those)
-   META tags management (similar to https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet)
-   CLI client for dev, build and publish tasks (see https://github.com/lukeed/sade)
-   Find out if front and back routers support named routes
